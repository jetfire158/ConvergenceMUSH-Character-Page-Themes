Hey all, I made some CSS templates for anyone to use for character pages. I've finished tweaking the first one, which is a fantasy theme with forest vibes. The file contains 2 copies of the code. The first one has notes about what each section controls so you can make your own tweaks if you want, it can be pasted into any browser's dev tools to preview what it will look like. To do this, you can go to your own page and right click, then click "inspect" or "view source" or something similar depending on your browser, then add a <style>...</style> section with your custom CSS in it. 

The second one is fully inline with brackets all escaped so that it is ready to be pasted directly into +info css . Also, if you'd like to add your own backgrond image, insert the image url into the .main section where it says 'PUT_YOUR_BACKGROUND_IMAGE_HERE'. Note that if you want to add your own background image, the url needs to replace the gradient properties, so your background should just say background: url('your_image_url_here');
